* ***Vision:*** Understanding how cultural health moments impact health consumers’ digital search behavior may provide insight into potential interception points relating to disease-state awareness, education, symptoms, diagnosis, and/or treatment.
* ***Issue:*** During high-profile health moments (ex. – the cancer-related deaths of Chadwick Boseman and Eddie Van Halen, or the cancer diagnosis of Jimmy Carter or Rush Limbaugh) digital health consumers’ initial search queries are typically surface-level search (ex. – scandal, wealth, career highlights, spouse, etc.), but that search behavior shifts to awareness, signs, symptoms, and introspection over time. Understanding that time horizon – when the shift occurs and what common topical trends exist – may provide opportunities to engage by leveraging naturally occurring awareness and search.
* ***Method:*** Examination of publicly available search data as related to high-profile disease state diagnosis and/or deaths. 
* ***Potential Output:*** Present a use case identifying the window of heightened awareness and interest among health consumers caused by cultural health moments for use within strategic campaign development for advocacy groups (ex. – Komen, American Cancer Society), payers (Aetna, Blue Cross), and/or healthcare companies.
